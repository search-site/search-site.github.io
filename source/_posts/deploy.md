# Deploy your application

> This page is part of the [App Framework Documentation](../DOCUMENTATION.md)

<br />

App Framework does many adjustments in the background to enable you to deploy your App easily as Web App or as native App. So you could start fast and become professional later on without any change. But what are the differences?

## Comparison between Web App and Native App

| &nbsp; |Web App|Native App|
|---|---|---|
|Installation|Are running in the device browser and could be pinned to the homescreen.|Are installed from an App Store or manually to the device (Android only).|
|Performance|Reload on reopen, but could be cached for offline usage. Offline warning.|Kept in runtime of the device, smoother usage. No offline warning.|
|Capability|Only browser features.|Access to the device hardware and OS features.|
|Deployment|In seconds.|Additional native build plus approval process, which takes some time and could be refused at the Apple App Store.|
|Costs|Firebase hosting service is free for small apps.|Apple App Store requires developer program (around 99€ per year), Google Play store requires registration fee (around 25 USD once). For selling apps, Apple and Google charge around 30% of the sales.|
|Promotion|All regular ways.|All regular ways plus special promotions and user ratings in the store.|

## Deployment to a FTP server (Web App)

- Run `npm run ftp` to deploy your latest build to your FTP server, on first call, the config file *ftp-config.json* is created automatically and you have to update it with your FTP server data
- For rollback, run `npm run ftp -- --version x.y.z`

## Deployment to Firebase Hosting (Web App)
