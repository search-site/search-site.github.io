## Optional

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) to make your application state-based and reactive
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) to use the reliable backend service provider
- [Cordova/PhoneGap](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/) to use device hardware API plugins
