# Requirements

> This page is part of the [App Framework Documentation](../DOCUMENTATION.md)

<br />

## App Framework

Before you develop for App Framework itself, you should be familiar how to work with App Framework in your own application. So, please follow the [end user documentation](../DOCUMENTATION.md) first.

## Enable development mode

To inform end users about wrong App Framework usage (forking instead of installing as a module), there is an error message on each script call.

For App Framework development, you have to create an empty file *.enable-dev-mode* in the project folder to suppress this warning.
