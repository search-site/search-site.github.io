# Build your application

> This page is part of the [App Framework Documentation](../DOCUMENTATION.md)

<br />

To deploy your application you need to build it before. App Framework makes it quite easy for you, bumps the version, compiles the scripts and merges them together. Your logo is used to create many icons and launch screen graphics and at the end all files are compressed to save bandwidth.

GZIP compression will be done in addition after deployment to Firebase hosting.

Each build command will update the *build* folder on success.

- Run `npm run patch` after bug-fixes and improvements (version bump to x.y.z+1)
- Run `npm run minor` after adding new functionality (version bump to x.y+1.0)
- Run `npm run major` after breaking backward-capability (version bump to x+1.0.0)
